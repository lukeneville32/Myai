MASTER GUIDE
Mya. — PREMIUM CREATOR MASTER GUIDE
Luxury digital brand operations & monetization blueprint
Private by Design • Curated Access • Intentional Content
________________


PART I — BRAND POSITIONING (WHY YOU MAKE MONEY)
Whorified is built on:
* Controlled access

* Limited availability

* Emotional restraint

* Visual intention

You are not selling volume. You are selling access to something not everyone gets.
Brand promise:
What you see is curated. What you access is earned.
________________


PART II — NON-NEGOTIABLE BOUNDARIES
These are stated once, then enforced silently.
Hard No’s (Not Available at Any Price)
   * Real-life meetups

   * Personal contact details

   * Third-party content

   * Anything illegal, unsafe, or degrading

   * Anything violating platform rules

   * No explanations, no debates

________________


PART III — PLATFORM STRATEGY
OnlyFans — Revenue & Depth
      * Monetization & subscriber retention

      * Controlled intimacy; no oversharing

      * Posting frequency: 3–4 feed posts/week, 2 PPV drops/week

      * Stories used strategically, not as obligation

Twitter/X — Discovery & Tease
         * Teasing curiosity, driving traffic

         * Cropped visuals, text teasers, brand voice

         * Never explicit; avoid over-linking or emotional replies

Instagram — Distance & Aesthetic
            * Build brand legitimacy

            * Editorial, fashion, mood-based visuals

            * No direct explicit marketing

Rule: No platform does everything. Each has a specific purpose.

1ST ALBUM
1️⃣ Album Locked In (Final Version)
📂 Preview Mode Only 😌
Album description:
Not the full experience.
Just enough to make you curious.
The rest is intentional.
This stays tease-first, classy, bratty, and clearly deliberate.

2️⃣ Tailored Photo Captions by Outfit
These are short, reusable, and algorithm-friendly. Rotate them — don’t stack the same tone back-to-back.

🔥 Lingerie (suggestive, controlled)
Think: straps, lace, mirrors, side angles — not spread
                                                                                                            * Still behaving.

                                                                                                            * Not undressed. Just dangerous.

                                                                                                            * This is me holding back.

                                                                                                            * Lace does most of the talking.

                                                                                                            * Covered where it counts.

                                                                                                            * Imagine the rest — I won’t help.

🖤 Streetwear (confident, cool, dominant tease)
Oversized hoodie, crop tops, cargos, sneakers
                                                                                                               * Cute but don’t try me.

                                                                                                               * This is how I lure you in.

                                                                                                               * I look innocent in daylight.

                                                                                                               * Casual doesn’t mean boring.

                                                                                                               * You’d never guess what’s under this.

🎭 Cosplay (playful, mischievous, brat-forward)
Schoolgirl vibes, anime-inspired, fantasy, playful props
                                                                                                                  * Character unlocked.

🌸 Casual / Soft Tease (home, bed, natural light)
Tees, sheets, bare legs, coffee shots
                                                                                                                     * This is the soft launch.

                                                                                                                     * Just me. Behaving.

3️⃣ Killer Pinned Profile Bio (Tease-First)
Here are three strong options — pick the one that fits your personality best.
🔥 Bratty Premium (Top Performer)
Preview mode only 😌
I show what I want — when I want.
Stay curious.
________________


💋 Soft but Dangerous
Sweet enough to look twice.
Dangerous enough to stay.
This is just the beginning.
________________


😈 Confident & Controlled
Not explicit. Still tempting.
Access is earned, not given.
👉 My recommendation:
 Use Option 1 while your account is still growing. It sets authority immediately.

4️⃣ Face, Tattoos & Identity — The Honest Truth
This is important, so here’s the real strategy, not influencer BS.
🔒 If anonymity matters (small town, safety, future plans):
YES — keep parts of yourself a mystery.
 Mystery does not hurt sales when done intentionally.
Best compromise (highly recommended):
                                                                                                                        * ✅ Partial face (eyes only, lips, side profile, shadow)

                                                                                                                        * ✅ Hair covering parts of face

                                                                                                                        * ✅ Angles from behind / over shoulder

                                                                                                                        * ✅ Crop tattoos or show one signature tattoo only

This creates:
                                                                                                                           * Safety

                                                                                                                           * Intrigue

                                                                                                                           * A recognizable vibe without full ID exposure

💰 Does showing your full face sell better?
Yes — but not immediately, and not always worth the trade-off.
                                                                                                                              * Full face = faster emotional attachment

                                                                                                                              * Mystery = slower burn but higher-quality subs

                                                                                                                              * MANY top creators reveal face later as a “special event” or paid unlock

👉 Think of your face as premium content, not a requirement.
